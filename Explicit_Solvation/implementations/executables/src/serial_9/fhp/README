This document takes you through the methods called to run a simulation. 
The simulation is run the following way:
1. Setting up topology, energetics, lattice, dumps, and perturbation. 
2. Running the perturbation and dumping out information. 

The `.run()` command has two possibilities: `straight` and `debug`. `debug` can be called using the `-v` option. `straight` can be called by leaving the `-v` option out when executing the code.
