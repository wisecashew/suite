Input file has no overlaps! Input polymers are well-connected! 

Preparing for take-off...

Chemical information: 
Number of polymers in system = 1.

Geometric information about simulation cell: 
x = 10, y = 10, z = 10.

Thermodynamic and energetic information about simulation: 
Temperature = 2.
Fraction of Solvent II = 1.
Monomer-Monomer energetics: isotropic, Emm_a = -1, Emm_n = -1.
Monomer-Solvent I energetics: isotropic, Ems1_a = 0, Ems1_n = 0.
Monomer-Solvent II energetics: isotropic, Ems2_a = -0, Ems2_n = -0.
Solvent I-Solvent II energetics: isotropic, Es1s2_a = -0, Es1s2_n = -0.
Off to a good start. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Running some more checks on input... 

Setting up the lattice from scratch! 
Input file has no overlaps! Input polymers are well-connected! 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Begin adding cosolvent... 
Number of particles of cosolvent being added is 992.
Cell has been solvated!
Solvation took 1495 microseconds.


Checking validity of coords...
checkForOverlaps says: Input file has no overlaps! true.
Input file has no overlaps! No random monomers floating around!!
Input file has no overlap between and internally amongst solvent and monomers!
checkConnectivity says: Input polymers are well-connected! 
true.
Input polymers are well-connected! 
We good. LATTICE is in good shape.
Cosolvent vector looks good!

Calculating energy...
Time required for serial computation = 806 microseconds. 
Energy of system is -7.

Initiation complete. We are ready to go. The engine will output information every 100000 configuration(s).
Number of iteration to perform: 10000000.
Number of hits is 17346.


Time taken for simulation: 2334.77 seconds.
That is all she wrote. Hope it worked.
