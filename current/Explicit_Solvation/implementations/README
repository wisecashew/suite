I have not updated this thing in a while. 

The HAMILTONIAN_GRAVEYARD is exactly what it sounds like. It is a whole bunch of hamiltonians and methods 
which did not work. Useful for seeing how I had implemented certain ideas. 

WangLandau is me running the Wang-Landau algorithm to calculate the density of states. Not particularly useful, but neat implementation. 

stacking_hamiltonian is an implementation of the stacking hamiltonian. 
locking_hamiltonian is an implementation of the locking hamiltonian. 

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! appropriately_sampled IS THE ONLY RIGOROUS IMPLEMENTED MONTE CARLO INTEGRATOR !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
It has been unit tested, and one can unit test it over and over, in case you make any changes.
