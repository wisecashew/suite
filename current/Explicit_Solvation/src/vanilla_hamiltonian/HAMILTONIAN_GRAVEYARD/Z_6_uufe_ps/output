Preparing for take-off...

Chemical information: 
Number of polymers is 1.

Geometric information about simulation cell: 
x = 212, y = 212, z = 212.

Thermodynamic and energetic information about simulation: 
Temperature = 0.1.
Emm_a = -0, Emm_n = -0, Ems_a = -1, Ems_n = -1.
 
Off to a good start. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Running some more checks on input... 

Input file has no overlaps!
Input polymers are well-connected!
Solvation took 313 milliseconds.
Cell has been solvated! 


Calculating energy...
Energy of system is -32.

Initiation complete. We are ready to go. The engine will output information every 1 configuration(s).


Time taken for simulation: 22219 milliseconds.
That is all she wrote. Hope it worked.
