Preparing for take-off...

Chemical information: 
Number of polymers is 1, fraction of solvent one is 0.5.

Geometric information about simulation cell: 
x = 10, y = 10, z = 10.

Thermodynamic and energetic information about simulation: 
Temperature = 0.1.
Emm_a = 0, Emm_n = 0, Ems1_a = -1, Ems1_n = -1, Ems2_a = -1, Ems2_n = -1.
 
Off to a good start. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Running some more checks on input... 

Input file has no overlaps!
Input polymers are well-connected!
Solvating the simulation cell... This can take some time. 

Number of particles of type 1 is 496.

Solvation took 0 milliseconds.
Cell has been solvated! 


Calculating energy...
Energy of system is -186.

Initiation complete. We are ready to go. The engine will output information every 1 configuration(s).
Number of surrounding solvent molecules is 186.
Step number: 1.
Performing a solvent exchange... 
Nsurr is 186, # of indices is 76
Executing...
Reversing solvent exchange...Rejected. Reversal in progress...
move_number is 8.
Checking validity of coords...Input file has no overlaps!
checkForOverlaps says: 1.
Input file has no overlaps!
No random monomers floating around!!
Input file has no overlap between and internally amongst solvent and monomers!
Input polymers are well-connected!
checkConnectivity says: 1
Input polymers are well-connected!
Reversed successfully!!
Energy of the system is -186.00.
This should be 1 as IMP_BOOL must be true on acceptance: 1
Bad location is 8 | 0 | 0 | 
LATTICE says 0 | 1 | 1 | 
Something is fucked. Pointer does not correspond to position.
