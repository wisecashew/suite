This is a simulation engine which incorporates directional bonding between monomer and solvent. 
Here, each particle is given a discrete orientation. This orientation affects the energy of interaction two neighboring particles experience. All moves are performed with Boltzmann biasing. 
In this implementation, I have employed reversing moves to avoid copying. Did wonders for efficiency. 
There are two versions of this simulation. One is biased, the other one is unbiased.
