What I need to do is implement first solvation shell flips with bias. 
Next, I need to implement second solvation shell flips with bias. 
Then, I need to implement identity swaps. 

Once this has been done, I will run unit tests. I do not want simulations to crash. Somehow find a way to visualize results.
