Preparing for take-off...

Chemical information: 
Number of polymers is 1.

Geometric information about simulation cell: 
x = 10, y = 10, z = 10.

Thermodynamic and energetic information about simulation: 
Temperature = 1.
Emm_a = -1, Emm_n = -1, Ems_a = -0, Ems_n = -0.
 
Off to a good start. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Running some more checks on input... 

Setting up the lattice from scratch! 
Input file has no overlaps!
Input polymers are well-connected!
Solvation took 1 milliseconds.
Cell has been solvated! 


Calculating energy...
Energy of system is -7.

Initiation complete. We are ready to go. The engine will output information every 100000 configuration(s).
Number of iteration to perform: 10000000.
Number of hits = 293941


Time taken for simulation: 517699 milliseconds.
That is all she wrote. Hope it worked.
